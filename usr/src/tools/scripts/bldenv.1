.SH NAME
.I bldenv
\- spawn shell for interactive incremental OS-Net consolidation builds
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBbldenv [-fd] [+t] [-S E|H|D|O] <env_file> [command]\fP
.LP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX "OS-Net build tools" "bldenv" "" "\fBbldenv\fP"
.LP
.I bldenv
is a useful companion to the nightly(1) script for doing interactive
and incremental builds in a workspace already built with nightly(1). 
.I bldenv
spawns a shell set up with the same environment variables taken
from an
.I env_file,
as prepared for use with nightly(1).
.LP
In addition to running a shell for interactive use,
.I bldenv
can optionally run a single command in the given environment, in the
vein of sh -c or su -c.  This is useful for scripting, when an
interactive shell would not be.  If the command is composed of multiple
shell words or contains other shell metacharacters, it must be quoted
appropriately.
.LP
.I bldenv
is particularly useful for testing Makefile targets like
clobber, install and _msg, which otherwise require digging
through large build logs to figure out what is being done.
.LP
.I bldenv
is also useful if you run into build issues with
the source product or when generating OpenSolaris deliverables.  If a
source product build is flagged, the environment is set up for
building the indicated source product tree, which is assumed to have
already been created.  If the OpenSolaris deliverables flag
(\fB\-O\fR) is set in NIGHTLY_OPTIONS, the environment is set up for
building just the open source.  This includes using an alternate proto
area, as well as using the closed binaries in
$CODEMGR_WS/closed.skel (which is assumed to already exist).
.LP
By default, bldenv will invoke the shell specified in $SHELL.
If $SHELL isn't set or is invalid, csh will be used.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 10
.B \-c
force the use of csh, regardless of the value of $SHELL.
.TP
.B \-f
invoke csh with the -f (fast-start) option.  This option is valid
only if $SHELL is unset or if it points to csh.
.TP
.B \-d
set up environment for doing DEBUG builds (default is non-DEBUG)
.TP
.B \-t
Build and use the tools in usr/src/tools (default setting).
.TP
.B \+t
Use the build tools in "$ONBLD_TOOLS/bin".
.TP
.B \-S E
build the exportable source variant of the source product
.TP
.B \-S D
build the domestic source (exportable + crypt) variant of the source product
.TP
.B \-S H
build hybrid source (binaries + deleted source)
.TP
.B \-S O
simulate an OpenSolaris (open source only) build
.LP
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
.B Example 1: Interactive use
.LP
Use
.I bldenv
to spawn a shell to perform a DEBUG build and testing
of the Makefile targets clobber and install for usr/src/cmd/true.
.LP
.PD 0
.LP
% rlogin wopr-2 -l gk

Using /usr/bin/tcsh as shell.
