/*
 * In order to let the DTrace fasttrap provider trace processes before libc
 * is initialized, we place this structure in the thread pointer register.
 * This is communicated to the kernel (in the elfexec() function) by
 * placing the address of this structure in the PT_SUNWDTRACE program header
 * with the -zdtrace_data=<object> option to ld.
 *
 * The fields of the program header are set as follows:
 *	p_type:         PT_SUNWDTRACE
 *	p_vaddr:        address of dtrace_data
 *	p_memsz:        size of dtrace_data
 *	p_flags:        flags of segment dtrace_data is assigned to
 *	p_paddr:        <reserved>
 *	p_filesz:       <reserved>
 *	p_offset:       <reserved>
 *	p_align:        <reserved>
 *
 * See the comment in fasttrap.h for information on how to safely change
 * this data structure and the other places that need to be kept in sync.
 *
 * NOTE: If you use DTrace fasttrap provider, you need to define
 *       -DUSE_DTRACE in arm/Makefile.
